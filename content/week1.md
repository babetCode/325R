Due Thursday, January 16th

**Learning Objectives:** Upon completion of the following topic (from in class lectures and completion of the external brain assignments), you will be able to:
1. Describe and provide examples of how biomechanics may be studies at many levels,
ranging from single cell to full organism.
2. Analyze how a solid understanding of biomechanics may be relevant to your current
studies in kinesiology future career goals.
3. Define the basic sub-disciplines of mechanics and explain how they relate to each other.

**Assignments:**
1. Use words or images to provide an example of something which a biomechanist might study at each of the following levels. Remember, biomechanics typically involved the **study of movement or forces causing the movement**:
    - Whole organism level
    - System level
    - Organ level
    - Tissue level
    - Cell level
    - Cellular subunits level

**Whole Organism:** Gait analysis of the whole organism  
**System level:** Muscular system and the movement it produces  
**Organ level:** Individual muscle, or perhaps heart or lungs if combinging biomechanics with physiology  
**Tissue level:** Tendon, ligament, or bone tissue  
**Cell level:** Myocytes  
**Cellular subunits level:**

2. Using either Pubmed or Google Scholar, find an article showing an example of
biomechanics being applied for either 1) improving health or 2) improving sport
performance. Include the abstract from the article, complete APA formatted citation, and a short explanation for how you think this article represents biomechanics being applied to this specific area.

3. Basic Vocabulary and Conceptual Relationships  
Create a concept map or schematic diagram which shows the relationship among the following terms. Be sure to include definitions for the words:
    - Mechanics
    - Rigid body dynamics
    - Deformable body mechanics
    - Statics
    - Dynamics
    - Kinematics
    - Position
    - Velocity
    - Acceleration
    - Kinetics
    - Force
    - Torque
